# LearnUp - learning management system  

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate efficient communication and interaction between teachers and students in an educational setting. It aims to streamline the process of assigning and submitting assignments, providing feedback, and fostering collaboration within a digital environment.

This repository contains **Eureka Server** implementation. This was designed to monitor performance of microservices. It serves as an alternative to Spring Actutator.

**Technologies Used**
* Java  
Java provides a robust and scalable backend infrastructure for the LMS. Its object-oriented nature allows for the efficient handling of complex data structures and logic required for user management, authentication, and data manipulation.

* React  
React is utilized for the frontend development, offering a dynamic and interactive user interface. Its component-based architecture enables the creation of reusable UI elements, enhancing maintainability and scalability.

* Spring Boot  
Spring Boot serves as the foundation for building the backend RESTful APIs. Its convention-over-configuration approach simplifies the setup and development of Java-based applications, speeding up the development process and promoting code consistency.

**Challenges Faced**
* Web Socket Integration  
Implementing web sockets posed a significant challenge, especially in enabling real-time notification system between teachers and students. Overcoming this hurdle required thorough understanding of web socket protocols and meticulous integration within the application architecture.

**Future Features**
* Chat System  
One of the key features planned for future implementation is a chat system between teachers and students. This will enable seamless communication, allowing for quick clarification of doubts and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

**How to Run**
* Clone the repository.
* Open the project in IntelliJ or any other IDE.
* Run this application first and then run other microservices one by one.
* Access the application through the provided URL.
